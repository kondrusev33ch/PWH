# Plant Watering Helper
I created this project specifically for my resume. [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) was used for the visual base.

I have more than 15 different kinds of plants at home, sometimes I forget to water them in time, so I decide to create application that will help me water my plants when needed.

![PWH_proj](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85990934/122192267-2c657a00-ce9c-11eb-8e2c-282543829077.jpg)

This is a prety simple application, just shows how many days left untill next watering need to be done and water amount needed. 

## Instalation
1. Create empty folder where you want;
2. Copy ***resources*** folder from repository to your new folder from step 1;
3. Copy ***PWH.exe*** file to folder from step 1, create a shortcut or pin to taskbar as you wish and you're ready, but I recommend you to do following steps for more convenient use; 
4. Press ***Win + R*** (for Windows) to open Run panel, then paste ***shell:startup*** to it and press ***OK***, you will get a File Explorer window (do not close it);
5. Now make a ***PWH.exe*** shortcut and put it to the File Explorer window you got from step 4, then you can close it;

Step 4 and 5 make program start automaticaly. If you do not need it, just skip;

## How to use
* Press **Add** button to add plant. You will need to enter some information about your plant, just follow instructions.
* Press **Del** button to delete plant. Each plant has a unique id, so you only need to type the correct id from the top list.
* Press **Water** button to let the program know that all plants (which need to be watered) were watered.
* Press **Exit** button to save and exit.
